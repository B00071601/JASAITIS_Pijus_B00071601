<h2>History</h2>
<p>
One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself<br>
    transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back,<br>
    and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly<br>
    domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able<br>
    to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully<br>
    thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he<br>
    looked. "What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a<br>
    proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four<br>
    familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa<br>
    was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently<br>
    cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a<br>
    lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff<br>
    that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. Gregor then turned to<br>
    look out the window at the dull weather.
